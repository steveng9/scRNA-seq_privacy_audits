## [Track I: bulk RNA-seq](/experiments/track_i/) 

**Track I** focuses on **bulk RNA-seq** data and followsa Blue Team (🫐) vs Red Team (🍅) framework. The goal is to explore the privacy-preserving aspects of generative methods while assessing their resilience against membership inference attacks.

Visit the [Track I Home Page](/experiments/track_i/) for detailed instructions. 



## [Track II: single-cell RNA-seq](/experiments/track_ii/)

**Track II** focuses on **single-cell RNA-seq** data and operates under a Blue Team (🫐) framework. This track aims to identify and analyze potential privacy risks associated with generating synthetic single-cell gene expression datasets.
